2024-09-09	Blind Image Deblurring With FFT-ReLU Sparsity Prior	Under Review	The paper introduces a method for blind image deblurring, which is the process of recovering a sharp image from a blurred one without prior knowledge about the blur kernel. The proposed method leverages a prior that targets the blur kernel to achieve effective deblurring across a wide range of image types. The authors' extensive empirical analysis shows that their algorithm achieves results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art blind image deblurring algorithms, and it offers up to two times faster inference, making it a highly efficient solution.
