A habit tracking mobile application that lets users set and monitor habits like daily walking distance, visualizing progress across days, weeks, and months. It also features a smart to-do list that prioritizes tasks based on user-set parameters like deadline, importance, and enjoyment, all wrapped in a seamless mobile experience built with Dart.
