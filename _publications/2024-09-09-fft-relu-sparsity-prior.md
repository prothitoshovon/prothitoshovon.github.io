excerpt: 'The paper introduces a method for blind image deblurring, which is the process of recovering a sharp image from a blurred one without prior knowledge about the blur kernel. The proposed method leverages a prior that targets the blur kernel to achieve effective deblurring across a wide range of image types. The authors&apos; extensive empirical analysis shows that their algorithm achieves results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art blind image deblurring algorithms, and it offers up to two times faster inference, making it a highly efficient solution.'
abstract: 'Blind image deblurring is the process of recovering a sharp image from a blurred one without prior knowledge about the blur kernel. It is a small data problem, since the key challenge lies in estimating the unknown degrees of blur from a single image or limited data, instead of learning from large datasets. The solution depends heavily on developing algorithms that effectively model the image degradation process. We introduce a method that leverages a prior which targets the blur kernel to achieve effective deblurring across a wide range of image types. In our extensive empirical analysis, our algorithm achieves results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art blind image deblurring algorithms, and it offers up to two times faster inference, making it a highly efficient solution.'
